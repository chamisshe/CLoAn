# Annotation Guide
Hi! Thanks for doing annotation works for this project.

Manual annotation is often tedious, but I'm trying to make it **as smooth as possible** for You, the Annotator. This is why I wrote a custom Terminal User Interface (TUI) for this particular type of annotation. Since the goal of the project is a contrastive dataset of loanwords/native words, I named this tool _**CLoAn**_, short for _**C**ontrastive **Lo**anword **An**notator_. 

The following chapters serve to provide a both an overview of the functionality of CLoAn and an annotation guide.

### Starting up
Once you've installed the tool (instructions in the `README`), you'll want to run it. Since it relies on a number of Python-modules, make sure you're running it inside the proper virtual environment.
